    "Metabox is a high-level Python package specifically designed for the creation, evaluation, and inverse optimization of diffractive optical systems. Leaning on the robust capabilities of TensorFlow, metabox offers a comprehensive and user-friendly API for optical system design. The package is built with flexibility at its core, making it easy to add new components, define custom merit functions, and employ various optimization algorithms. It’s designed to be highly performant and scalable, capable of managing systems with millions of degrees of freedom. With its intuitive structure, metabox facilitates the design of intricate diffractive optical systems with minimal lines of code.\n",

    "**Key features of metabox include**:\n",
    "1. A rcwa solver, derived from rcwa_tf, for direct computation of meta-atoms’ diffraction efficiency.\n",
    "2. A built-in raster module for parameterizing meta-atoms’ features.\n",
    "3. An easy-to-use sampling system for features, which can train a metamodel to replace the rcwa solver, thus significantly speeding up simulations and optimization processes.\n",
    "4. A module for sequential optics to model light propagation through the optical system.\n",
    "5. An assembly module offering a suite of tools for building the optical system from meta-atoms, apertures, and other optical components.\n",
    "6. A merit module for evaluating and inverse-designing the performance of the optical system.\n",
    "7. An rcwa.Material class for accessing pre-defined materials and their optical properties.\n",
    "8. An export module that allows for the export of the diffractive optical design to a .gds file for fabrication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, metabox is a powerful tool for both beginners and experienced users in the field of optical system design. By simplifying and accelerating the design process, it paves the way for innovative developments in the optical industry"
